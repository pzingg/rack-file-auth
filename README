The idea is to provide a Rack application based on Rack::File
that follows the Apache "Indexes" option to serve up index.html
files found in a directory.  On top of that there is an
authorization middleware level that checks for a session cookie
created by a Ruby on Rails application on the same host.
If found, the files are served.  If not found (or not a valid
session cookie), the user is redirected to the Rails app.

The associated Rails app uses the authlogic gem to encode
the valid session cookie.

Also includes a Google Analytics middleware that injects our
GA account id and GA script just before the </body> tag at the
end of the page.  Based on the Filters::GoogleAnalytics mod_perl
Apache filter.

Configuration using Phusion Passenger on OS X Leopard Server

Edit httpd.conf.  Enable Phusion Passenger:

LoadModule passenger_module /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.0.6/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so

Edit sites/0003_....conf file.  Add this to VirtualHost section:

<VirtualHost ...>
   DocumentRoot "...."

   # url for this Rack application
   RackBaseURI /static
   RackEnv production

   # url for the Rails application that handles logins	
   RailsBaseURI /mgmt
   RailsEnv production
   RailsAllowModRewrite off
</VirtualHost>
