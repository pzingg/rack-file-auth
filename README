The idea is to provide a Rack application based on Rack::File
that follows the Apache "Indexes" option to serve up index.html
files found in a directory.  On top of that there is an
authorization middleware level that checks for a session cookie
created by a Ruby on Rails application on the same host.
If found, the files are served.  If not found (or not a valid
session cookie), the user is redirected to the Rails app.

The associated Rails app uses the authlogic gem to encode
the valid session cookie.
